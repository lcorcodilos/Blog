I'm writing this post from a hammock I set up in the park on a beautiful 70Â° day in the middle of April.
The sun is warm, the breeze is cool, the sky is clear blue, and the birds are chirping patiently at each other.
I've been in Baltimore for 5 and 1/2 years and I've never done this.

I've always noticed beautiful weather like this in the past - even in this specific park, blooming with
pink flowers - and thought I should take some time to enjoy it. But it was never more than a 60-second
stop to breathe on my way to something more pressing. While doing my PhD, the only real time I remember
taking a break to sit outside on a nice day was right after I finished my oral exam to transition to a
PhD candidacy. I felt I deserved the 30-minute break as a way of rewarding my success. But why did it
have to be a reward? Why can't hours relaxing in nice weather like this just be a normal part of life?

To be fair, since starting my "funemployment", I haven't done a lot of this either and I mainly attributed
that to the colder weather of January, February, and March. That may not be fair though because the only
reason I allowed myself this today is because I have a break in interviews that I think have been going
pretty well. It feels like I deserve a break to stop and enjoy the weather and reflect a bit on how the
past 3 months have gone as I began my post-academia job search.

I've spent a lot of time thinking about this and talking about it with others and even though I don't even
have a job offer in hand yet, I think now is an appropriate time to start writing about this experience.
I have a slight fear that once I have the offer in hand and accept, it's all going to have felt so simple
and easy when in reality, this was very uncharted territory and it felt like very few people I talked to
knew exactly what to tell me so I could chart a course.

I hope that this post will help me sell reflect but will also serve as a resource for others to break through
(what I see as) a lot of necessary nonsense on the path towards finding a rewarding career outside of physics.
I never thought I would be in a position where I felt qualified to write this. However, the screening interview
rate on data science positions is between 3 and 4% and I'm currently sitting in about 17%. So it may have taken
me 3 months, but I figured something out at some point and I'm hoping this post identifies what.

# The Bullets
= My timeline
= Online communities: What to expect
= The basics of applying to jobs and understanding the job market
- Know your competition
--- Masters students, other PhDs, people with experience
- Language and talking about your experience
--- Resume
--- "Academic" is a dirty word. You are not a physicist applying to data science jobs - you are a data scientist.
- Online presence: Why LinkedIn is dumb
--- GitHub, personal sites, etc
- Finding jobs vs finding companies
--- Researching companies, asking good questions, framing your experience
- Things you need to do ahead of time
--- Learn the language and write/practice your key bullets
--- Establish yourself online through code and a webpage
--- Practice with non-physics datasets, read non-physics books, participate in communities not centered on physics
--- Tell your advisors ahead of time your plans and set deadlines and expectations that you are going to do
this prep ahead of graduation
--- Plan to take a month or two off for a break! Your friends taking post-docs are doing the same.
Plan for job search ("I have nothing" to "offer accepted") to take 6 months. That may take financial planning!

- Stop looking for job postings and start looking for companies. Tell companies this is what you're doing.
- Recognize that the language you speak is very different than the ones spoken outside of academia. You are traveling to their land so it's your responsibility to learn their language - not the other way around.
- As you get older, LinkedIn is the new Facebook. It's just as toxic and useless and built on lies. I understanding the system, you can leverage it to your own advantage but don't expect to build a meaningful network of people like advertised. Networking in the digital age is built through cold emails to people *you* think are working on cool stuff. People love to talk about themselves so don't be afraid to reach out.
- Distill your skills down to three to five bullet points. You should have short, tailored, pre-written descriptions for each, ready to use at your disposal when writing cold emails, "cover letters", and doing screening interviews. You should be able to implicitly tie these back to the company or the role description so you can talk about yourself and the company in the same sentence. Get the interviewer to see you being part of the team.
- Likewise, you should have short, medium, and long versions of the description of your background at the ready. You don't need to memorize anything, just make sure you know what to drop when you need to be brief.
- Speak confidently, even if you are unsure. Businesses commit to projects they've never done before all of the time. You'll be expected to do the same once you're hired. In other words, even if you're unsure you can do something, say you can anyway.
- When you get an interview, spend at least an hour reading as much of the company website as you can. Write question as you think of them and if you find answers, write the pairing answer. Asking about team size and technical stack are reasonable. But the questions that will impress people are about how the business operates, what their goals are, understanding how your role benefits the revenue model. THESE SHOULD ALL BE ASKED IN THE CONTEXT OF "I read A on company website so I'm wondering..." You're identifying responsibilities, the impact of your potential work, and how the company is going to invest in the role going forward (ie salary bumps, promotions, and team growth). This is helpful for you but it immediately separates you from a pack of people who didn't bother to consider the simplest question of how the company exists. If you can't be bothered with these, move on and find another company. You're not going to find a meaningful role there if can't even get yourself motivated for an hour or two.
- To really impress people, build an online presence outside of LinkedIn. Personal websites are great because they are a platform/website you built and control. GitHub is paramount to showing you have engineering skills. If you don't have code on GitHub or some other public platform, that should be your top priority.
- Every bit of software engineering you have is an advantage over the onslaught of applicants with just statistics experience. HR may not care but upper level data scientist management KNOWS the value of technical engineering. Being a "quick learner" is fine for catching up on specific ML techniques but does nothing for software engineering experience which can only be obtained with time.
- You CAN get beat by business analysts who memorized all of the machine learning algorithms over a two year program. You won't have to also have all of these memorized if you leverage that your "projects" are published research in impactful journals. There's honor in losing out on a job to another PhD or someone with years of industry experience but you shouldn't lose out to someone who can only has the data science masters and no real portfolio or experience. If you do, that's a bullet dodged - you wouldn't grow at that company anyway.
- As I heard in a workshop run by CERN, "academic" is a dirty word. I never wanted to believe that but it's very real. I used online forums to get feedback on my resume and people derailed the real feedback to complain about PhDs they had hired. The good news for you is that you don't want to work for these people and they will self-select when they read your resume. It's not as if losing the PhD would help you though. There are plenty of jobs that won't hire unless you have a STEM PhD.
